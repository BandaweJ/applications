# applications
This is a web based online applications portal for high school applicants.
Prospective applicants fill in a form on the **New** tab.
They then submit the application.
The applicant is issued with a **student number** upon successful application submission.
The student can then use that student number to track or view the status of the application.
This is done on the **Track** tab.
Registered schools can log in and view applications made to their respective schools.
They can then action them by either *accepting, rejecting or leave them pending*.
